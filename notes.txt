- Popup: Function called with setTimeout(func , num000)
- access value of a key in object: this.key
- Change object with a function: adding or accessing values of it. const ... = func() {
  return something happens to this.key }

obj.func = func() //now ... : func() is in obj. 
- Do something with this.key: call, apply, bind
- create new object by: 
const constructor0 = {func(this... = ....);}; 
new constructor0(); // {.. : ....}
- make a prototype of an obj without changing it at all:
const prototype = {
  key1: value1
  func1: func() = {something happens to this.key_of_other_object}
}
obj.__proto__ = prototype // now prototype is part of obj and u can access their keys by using obj.prototype_key and obj has no even change
- access keys of obj with prototype and keys of prototype: (for in obj)
- access keys of original obj: for in obj{ if (obj.hasOwnProperty)}
- change value ob obj: obj.key = new value

- Math.sqrt(), Math.pow()
- functions and constants can also have types
- static?: constants, variables that are "sticked" static .. to an obj. You cannot create another object obj1 and call it with it. obj1...
- implement?: implement the values of an interface in a data type. 
- extend: inherit or extends the behavior of another one --> useful for parent id in answer
- readonly: read 
- for..in statement: iterates over keys returns values

Documentation:
  https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies: 
  - cookies.has("session")
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken: Is ours token symmetric - synchronous?
  Useful:
  - complete: return an object with the decoded { payload, header, signature } instead of only the usual content of the payload.
  - expiresIn vs maxAge?
  - TokenExpiredError
  - JsonWebTokenError
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt
  - is hash encrypting?
  - hash password: bcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds)
  check a password: bcrypt.compare(myPlaintextPassword)
  We are not using synchronous so I don't need to pay attention to sync ways to hash or compare.

- Ensure user identity and check session cookies before granting access to specific pages or API routes, Redirect users at the server level based on certain conditions. 
- define which paths Middleware will run on: 
export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*' or ['/about/:path*', '/dashboard/:path*'],
}
