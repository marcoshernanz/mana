  Title

  Tags
    Create tags
    The app starts with no tags. The user creates tags and then has the ability to select them
  IsRead
  Add
  
Pages
  Something like this but the pages should be the size of the screen https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/carousel
  First page is to add new blog posts
  Next pages are the blogs that aren't read
  The user should have the ability to navigate through the unread blog posts by clicking arrow buttons.
  
  const [pageNumber, setPageNumber] = useState<number>(0)
  Button with onClick to set page number to one less
  Button with onClick to set page number to one more
  Conditionally render the page you're in
  {
    pageNumber === 0 ? <WriteBlogPost />
    : <BlogPost blogPost={blogPosts[pageNumber - 1]} />
  }
  
   BlogPost {
    title
    text
    selectedTags: string[]
    isRead
  }

  (to insert in local storage)
  data  {
    pageNumber
    allTags
    blogPosts: BlogPost[]
    
    (save the inputs in case of reload while writing)

Make twitter

No uppercase variable. Only uppercase components and types

Schema
Server actions to insert, delete, update and select
Replace localStorage with the server actions created before
Don't use useState to insert, update or delete - use server actions, then use server action again to select, and setState with the selected data

Twitter schema:
  id: string
  author: string
  text: string
  parentTweetId: string;
  isLiked: bool

If parentTweetId -> tweet is a reply

Selecting tweet replies
db.select().from(tweetsTable).where(eq(parentTweetId), <ID>); -> Gets the replies for the tweet with id = <ID>

- Order by my order, date, and starred
- Edit tasks
- Drag and drop to reorder

Weird behaviour: When i create a tweet and like it, and later delete it, i have an error in the whole screen.



Observations (is ok?):
- when i delete a task, i delete subtasks, therefore, when task is completed and i delete it, i also delete subtask
